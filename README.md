MLB videos

The goal of this project is to create an interface of the highlight videos found on MLB's gd2 database. The result will be a webpage built with php.

The original version used PHP along with HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
The is a new version that will hopefully only need JavaScript and HTML/CSS.
